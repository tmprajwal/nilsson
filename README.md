nilsson
=======

An implementation of the [Nilsson model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilsson_model) of the nuclear structure of deformed nuclei.

To make a plot of energy levels versus deformation, use the spaghetti script. This requires that you have the R language installed
(debian package r-base).

Dependencies:

apt-get install python3-numpy python3-sympy python3-scipy r-base

The r-base package is only needed if you want to do spaghetti plots.
